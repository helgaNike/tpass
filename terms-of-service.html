                        You are also responsible for maintaining the security of your account and for all activities
                        that occur

                        You agree to use our services only for lawful purposes and in a manner that does not infringe
                        upon the

                    </p>

                    <h2>Content Ownership</h2>
                    <p>
                        All content provided through our services, including but not limited to text, graphics, logos,
                        and
                        software, is owned by us or our licensors and is protected by copyright and intellectual
                        property laws.
                        You may not reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works based on our content without
                        explicit
                        permission. The integrity and protection of our intellectual property are fundamental to our
                        operation.
                        We reserve all rights not expressly granted under this agreement, and unauthorized use may
                        result in
                        legal consequences.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Prohibited Activities</h2>
                    <p>
                        You are strictly prohibited from engaging in any activities that compromise the security,
                        functionality,
                        or fairness of our services. This includes spamming, hacking, distributing malware, or using our
                        platform for illegal activities.
                        Engaging in such activities may result in immediate suspension or termination of your account
                        and could
                        also expose you to legal action.
                        We employ measures to monitor and prevent such abuses, and users found engaging in prohibited
                        activities
                        will be held accountable.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Payment and Fees</h2>
                    <p>
                        Some of our services require payment. By using these paid services, you agree to pay the
                        applicable fees
                        and any additional costs that may arise during your use.
                        All fees are non-refundable unless specified otherwise in a separate agreement or policy. It is
                        your
                        responsibility to ensure that payment details are current and valid.
                        We reserve the right to modify pricing at any time, and continued use after such changes implies
                        acceptance of the new terms.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Termination of Service</h2>
                    <p>
                        We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to our services for any reason,
                        including but
                        not limited to violations of these terms or security concerns.
                        In such cases, we will notify you if possible, but immediate suspension may occur without notice
                        if
                        required for the safety of our users or the platform.
                        Termination does not waive our rights to seek further legal remedies if necessary, and any
                        obligations
                        accrued before termination will remain enforceable.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Limitations of Liability</h2>
                    <p>
                        We are not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages that may arise from

                        liability is limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Indemnification</h2>
                    <p>
                        You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims, damages, or expenses that may arise
                        from
                        your use of our services.
                        This includes, but is not limited to, legal fees and liabilities incurred due to your violation
                        of these
                        terms or any applicable laws.
                        We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject
                        to
                        indemnification and expect full cooperation from you in these cases.

                    <p>
                        We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of our services at any time,
                        with or
                        without prior notice.
                        These changes may be necessary to improve functionality, comply with legal requirements, or
                        enhance
                        security. We will endeavor to minimize disruption, but you acknowledge that such changes are
                        part of
